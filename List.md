#### Features

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the features currently included :

+ Available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, the latter having a significant speed increase from 32bit
+ Includes the required environment to crack passwords using GPGPU with openCL and CUDA configured 'out of the box'
+ Built on hardened linux, including a hardened kernel (with extra patches) and toolchain
+ Backported Wifi stack from latest stable kernel release
+ Uses a pentoo overlay, which allows tools to be built on top of a standard gentoo build
+ Module loading support ala slax
+ Changes saving on usb stick
+ XFCE4 wm
+ Support for full disk encryption with LUKs if installed on HDD
+ Automated installation
+ System updates if you got it finally installed

(...)it's basically a highly customizable Linux-based operating system and a meta-distribution. Using excellent development techniques, we have created a pre-configured security-focused or so called penetration testing LiveCD distribution that is built automatically from source code and is customized with the functionality that you want to have and without the unnecessary features that you want to avoid, with lots of customized tools, customized kernel, and much more.
